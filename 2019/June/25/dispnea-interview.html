		<h5>June 25, 2019</h5>

        <p>
		<b>Why did you start making music and why did you chose this band name?</b>
		<br>
		Dispnea was born to give vent to the anger and negativity they had and we still have inside. The name of our band was proposed by I. Which suffered from this respiratory pathology in a particular period of his life, an experience that has marked him a lot. 
		<br>
		<b>When did you form your band?</b>
		<br>
		We formed at the end of 2016 
		<br>
		<b>Who are your major influences?</b>
		<br>
		Our main influences are Old school black metal, depressive melodies and living sickness.</p>

		<p>
		<b>Are you signed to any record label?</b>
		<br>
			No.
		<br>
		
		<b>Do you play live? If so, do you have any gigs planned? Did you open for any well-known band?</b>
		<br>
		We are an active band also for live performances, we are planning a concert in Naples on June 29th with the Prison of Mirrors, another great black metal band from Campania. We have never opened to more known groups but it is something that does not particularly interest us.

		<p>
		<b>Could you briefly describe your music making process?</b>
<br>
		Primarily E. He writes the music and I. the lyrics. Once the material has been knocked out we arrange everything in the rehearsal room. 
<br>
<b>What has been your biggest challenge as a band? Have you been able to overcome that challenge? If so, how?</b>

<br>
Musically, our biggest challenge was to be able to achieve our debut ep against everything and everyone.

		<p>
		<b>What is your ultimate direction for your band?</b>
<br>
		Nothing so far from what we are doing. 
		<br>
<b>What advice would you give to musicians who want to start a black metal band?</b>

<br>
Our advice to musicians who want to take the road to black metal is to always remember that life is shit. </p>

		<p>
		<b>Did anyone support your project emotionally or financially?</b>
<br>
		10. No one has a finger for dispnea, it is all blood and sweat from our limbs. </p>
