		<h3>Interview: Wintaar</h3>
		<h5>May 27, 2019</h5>
		<img src="imgs/wintaar.jpg" width="450" height="330">
        <p><b>Why did you start making music and why did you chose this band name?</b>
  
<br>
     I started making music in 2007-2008 and Wintaar appeared in 2013. The name is a converted word “Winter”, this is the basic concept of the project, so everything is simple.

  
<br>

<b>When did you form your band?</b>

<br>
    I already have answered above, but I will clarify that it is not a band, but a one-man-project.
<br>
    

<b>Who are your major influences?</b>

<br>
    Satanic Warmaster. This is the only STRONG INFLUENCE. Such strong, that I wanted to play music under the impression of their music.
<br>
    

<b>Are you signed to any record label?</b>
  
<br>
    No, it’s not necessary in modern realities. Also, personally, it's not for me.
<br>
  

<b>Do you play live? If so, do you have any gigs planned? Did you open for any well-known band?</b>

<br>
    I never played my music live. But usually I rehearse in a project Rooforest with a bass player and drummer (I play the guitar and yell into the microphone, and all music is made by me), but this is still at the very beginning stage. Attempts to make Wintaar as a band ended up as two drunken rehearsals.
<br>
    

<b>Could you briefly describe your music making process?</b>

<br>
    I don’t know, it just happens, with varying degrees of intensity and regularity. Sometimes I write some riffs, lyric lines, melodies every day. Sometimes I don't do anything for weeks. I think it’s not possible to trace the beginning of the process, and it’s not really necessary.
<br>



<b>What do you think about your first song compared to your latest releases?</b>

<br>
    The sound is better now!
<br>
    

<b>What has been your biggest challenge as a band? Have you been able to overcome that challenge? If so, how?</b>

<br>
    In general, no difficulties. But sometimes It is difficult to play the parts that you, as a performer, are not able to play properly. I am self-taught and I have no "school" behind my back to get the necessary skills for playing the same riffs or singing (which you paradoxically have composed by yourself, haha).
<br>
    

<b>What is your ultimate direction for your band?</b>
    
<br>
    Black metal. In it’s different, but "pure" forms.
<br>



<b>What advice would you give to musicians who want to start a black metal band?</b>
   
<br>
    Just don’t start!



<br>
<b>Did anyone support your project emotionally or financially?</b>
		<br>

     Bandcamp listeners and recently other digital platforms users. Sometimes they buy my CDs and cassettes. Big thanks to them.</p>
