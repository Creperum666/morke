		<p><b>Why did you start making music and why did you chose this band name?</b>
<br>
 
This project was just a fuck around band that I did with Asura (LordOfPiss). I came up with the name do to my deep interest in Satanic Literature. When I moved I decided to keep the project running. My lyrics and atmosphere along side with my beliefs make up what this project is all about. My personal expression.
<br>
<b>When did you form your band?</b>
<br>

2015 in the Mountains of Arizona 
<br>
<b>Who are your major influences?</b>
<br>

I really enjoy Beastcraft, Darkthrone, and Burzum. I dont care to much for blasting drums. I'd rather have a hypnotic drum beat take me into a trance.
<br>
<b>Are you signed to any record label?</b>
<br>
 
I've worked with Depressive Illusions, but I'm officially signed with Wickedness. 
<br>
<b>Do you play live? If so, do you have any gigs planned? Did you open for any well-known band?</b>

<br> 
No I dont play live shows. It's not really my thing, my life is very busy as it is.
<br>

<b>Could you briefly describe your music making process?</b>

<br>
Mediation! Ritual work, and reading! 
Not to forget alchol and marijuana. 
<br>
<b>What do you think about your first song compared to your latest releases?</b>

<br>
I honestly dont know how to answer this. The only time my music in quality differs is when I have a featured artist. I guess it's cool to see how my views on the left hand path expand as my knowledge in the subject does as well.
<br>
<b>What has been your biggest challenge as a band? Have you been able to overcome that challenge? If so, how?</b>

<br> 
Time! I never seem to have time. I do most of my music at night after work. I guess another challenges is dealing with stupid people in the scene. 
<br>
<b>What is your ultimate direction for your band?</b>

<br> 
I just want respect from what I've manifested. I dont care to make money off this, as you can tell from my bandcamp prices. 
<br>
<b>What advice would you give to musicians who want to start a black metal band?</b>

<br>
Be orginal! I always hear people say they want to sound like this band or be like that band. Horrible! Experiment and have fun. Push boundaries and do what people hate or find offensive.
<br>
<b>Did anyone support your project emotionally or financially?</b>
<br>
Emotionally yes, my LunaMoonTide. She has always been there for me and made sure there was time to do what I do.
Financially, I work my ass off to buy what I can to record and what not. I couldn't even ask my family for help because they dont know I do this and I rather keep it that way. My dark little secret. Wickedness has supported me a lot through album art and promotion.
<br>

<b>What is the craziest thing you've done in the name of the band?</b>

<br>
One time while listening to Nunslaughter and drinking a few brews, LunaMoonTide and I vandalized a church. I dont know what came over me or possessed me but I started destroying what I could. I took the church door as a memorial. Good times.
